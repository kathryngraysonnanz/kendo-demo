# Welcome to LKARS Menu System

Hey friends! If you're looking for examples of where you can find the latest and greatest in KendoReact components, you're in the right place!

This is just a demo app to demonstrate component implementation, not really meant for full deployment, so it's probably missing some of the stuff you would need in a "real" app. If you see some questionable code or less-than-best practices, then (a) I'm not surprised and (b) just let me know and I'll give it a little clean up.

If you have any questions about how any of this was done, you're also more than welcome to reach out! Shoot me a message on Twitter (at)kathryngrayson, or email me at nanz(at)progress(dot)com – you'll never have to twist my arm to talk Kendo components :)

And if you don't have KendoReact yet, but want to – what are you waiting for? https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/
